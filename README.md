Title: Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation of Premier League season 2018-2019 outcome

Team: Yang Wu(yangwu4), Siyu Liu(SelamaAshalanore6)

Summary: As one of the most popular sports in Europe, even all over the world, the Premier League has become more competitive than ever. Itâ€™s very unpredictive which team would be more likely to win the championship title. By looking at a dataset consist information of 380 matches of last season and details including 42 features, this project is intended to use Monte Carlo to simulate 10,000 season outcomes to find out the likelihood/probability of every participating team to win the championship title after this on-going season.

Hypotheses:
Manchester City is the most likely candidate to win the championship title.

There are teams that could have 0 possibilities to win the championship title even in a large number of season outcome simulations.

Arsenal F.C. would be the least possible to be ranked within the top 4 comparing to other big six teams.
